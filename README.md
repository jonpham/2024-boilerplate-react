# Node + Version Manager
This repository uses NVM to manage and maintain a working node version.

It also uses Corepack/PNPM and associated lockfiles to indicate last working configuration in version control.

# Verification
## Mocked APIs
Mock Service Worker (MSW) [link]()

## Static Analysis (Linter)
The following are tools used to check code without transpiling or running tests for "correctness" & consistency.

### ESLint 
tbd

### Prettier

## Unit Tests
React-Testing-Library [link](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
